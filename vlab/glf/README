Please forgive this code, it was written by a security guy.

				--=[WebApp]=--

Summary: 
	The Webapp acts as a front end to the vlab environment, and does 
section creation and management, as well as disk image creation and 
management.  Each section has a nameable configuration which is 
automatically stored in the database.  and existing classes can be 
reconfigured to use stored configurations.

Security Model:
	This is an admin interface.  We have coded in as much redundant 
security as possible given the time constraints, but ultimately the 
admin is assumed to have full control of the server.

**FILES
AddClass.php 
- Front end form that takes in Course Number, Name, and Class Size and
  passes it onto MakeClass.php

AddImage.php
- Passes Image Details up to MakeImage.php.  
  THE IMAGE MUST ALREADY BE ON THE SERVER.

ClassInfo.php
- Collects the Class you want and passes it onto GetClassInfo.php

ConfigNICs.php
- For each nic in a Set of VM's we can select the networks that we  
  wish to have each machine assigned to, this selects the nets and then
  passes it onto Confirm.php

Configs.php 
- Displays a table and a drop down menu from which the admin can select 
  saved configurations for deletion.  This selection is then handed off 
  to DeleteConf.php

Confirm.php 
- Presents a summary of the configuration that is about to be created for 
  the section.  

conf.php
- configuration settings
